This is week one, not only because it's the first week of July, but also because it's the first weeknote I ever published.

Here's what I've been up to for the past week:

- üì∫ Started watching The Boys. I've run out of shows to watch, and I remember my brother saying this show is cool, so I gave it a shot.
- üìñ Reading Hannibal: The Pride of Carthange <!-- Might be nice to have a progress bar of my reading progress -->
- üèÉ Went afternoon jogging with my girlfriend. We had fun, considering both of us would rather stay indoors on a weekend. But, we need to build healthy habits, and this is a good start.
- ‚ú® Got my old domain back and revived this site! Cool discovery: Cloudflare sells domains without markup, so I got my old domain for cheaper than from Namecheap. Which is nice because I'm also using Cloudlfare Pages for deployment.

Been reading a bunch about weeknotes, favicons, etc.
